    <h2><strong>Information About the Show</strong></h2>
    <h3><i>About</i></h3>
    <p3>The worldâ€™s only consulting detective, Sherlock Holmes, who was played by Benedict Cumberbatch (<i>Star Trek Into Darkness, Dr. Strange</i>), teams up with his long-suffering, faithful friend, Dr. John Watson, played by Martin Freeman (<i>The Hobbit, Fargo</i>), to solve a dizzying array of crimes and battle diabolical villains with his signature deductive reasoning and his stunning lack of social grace. Co-created by Steven Moffat (<i>Doctor Who, Coupling</i>) and Mark Gatiss (<i>Doctor Who, The League of Gentlemen</i>), Sherlock also stars Amanda Abbington (<i>Mr. Selfridge</i>), Rupert Graves (<i>A Room with a View</i>), and Andrew Scott (<i>Spectre</i>).</p3>
